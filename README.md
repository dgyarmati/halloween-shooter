# Space Shooter Extravaganza #

A side-scroller space shooter built in JavaScript, using PixiJS.

**How to run**

Just clone/download the repo, and open index.html.

**Controls**
 
SPACE to shoot, arrow keys to move.

I used most of the sprites and some of the logic of [this project](https://github.com/Karzam/Spaceship_Tutorial_Part_1).
